I want to create a very simple, static but responsive landing page for a wedding website using next.js. 


For the first version:
Ceate a static landing page, with only a hero section div that contains a large background image. The image needs to always maintain the same aspect ratio while expanding to fill the entire viewport responsively. The image also needs to stay centered in the middle of the viewport as it scales.

I want to create a hero title in a div vertically centered in the top half of the image. The title should be white and say "Enchante!"

The first version will be a single page but we will later add more pages.
